# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This repository is documentation and reference material. There are no “supported versions” in the traditional software sense.

## Reporting a vulnerability or sensitive content

If you find:
- credentials/secrets accidentally committed,
- sensitive operational details,
- security-relevant mistakes in guidance that could cause harm,

please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead:
- If this is your repo: remove/rotate any exposed secrets immediately.
- Use a private communication channel appropriate for your organization.

## Safe usage reminder

Always follow your site’s security processes and change control. See `docs/DISCLAIMER.md`.
