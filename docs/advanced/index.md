# Advanced topics

This section is for deeper dives (performance, automation, debugging, security, ops).

## Good candidates

- SMF/RMF concepts and interpretation
- Batch performance triage
- RACF patterns (least privilege, auditing)
- USS + z/OSMF automation
- Language runtime tuning (LE, DB2, etc.)

Keep advanced topics actionable: problem statement → approach → example → caveats.
