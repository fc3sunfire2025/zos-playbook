# Getting oriented (101)

This section is for people new to z/OS or returning after time away.

## Suggested learning path

1. TSO/ISPF basics (navigation, editing, commands)
2. Dataset fundamentals (PS vs PDS/PDSE, naming, allocation)
3. JES basics (jobs, outputs, spool)
4. JCL fundamentals (JOB/EXEC/DD)
5. SDSF basics (viewing jobs, output)

## Where to contribute

- Add short explanations with examples.
- Keep each page focused on one topic.
- Prefer “what/why + a minimal example”.
